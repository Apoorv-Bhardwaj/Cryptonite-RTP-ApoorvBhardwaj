    "TopicInterviewer Asks...You Answer...Backprop\"How does a network learn?\"\"It uses the Chain Rule to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to every weight, moving backward from output to input.\"Adam\"Why use Adam?\"\"It combines Momentum (to get past local minima) and RMSprop (to scale learning rates for each parameter), making it fast and robust.\"Overfitting\"How do you stop overfitting?\"\"Dropout to prevent co-dependency, L2 Regularization to keep weights small, and Early Stopping.\"Batchnorm\"Why use Batch Normalization?\"\"It reduces Internal Covariate Shift, allows for higher learning rates, and acts as a slight regularizer.\"Vanishing Gradients\"Why is Sigmoid bad for deep nets?\"\"Its derivative is very small (max 0.25). Multiplying many small numbers during backprop causes the gradient to vanish.\"ReLU\"What is the Dying ReLU problem?\"\"If a neuron's input is always negative, it outputs 0. The gradient is 0, so it never updates. Solve it using Leaky ReLU.\"Initialization\"Can we init weights to zero?\"\"No. All neurons would do the exact same thing (symmetry). We need random initialization like He or Xavier.\""
