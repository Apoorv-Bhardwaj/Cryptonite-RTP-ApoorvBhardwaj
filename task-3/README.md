The scratch MLP has steadly learning with test R^2 of around 0.32 which explains 32% of the variance in wine quality.
The dataset is still noisy so prediction error of around 0.7 is expected but can be improved





The mlp classifier from scikit learn achieves nice 82% accuracy on validation and test sets.
It has good generalization.
An ROC-AUC of around 0.88 reveals discriminative ability between income classes.
It has a balance tradeoff between precision and recall.
